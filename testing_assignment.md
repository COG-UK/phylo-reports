# UK lineages summary report








This report gives summaries of UK specific lineages for week 2020-05-15. 
There are time lags due to batching, curation and analysis, the most recently sampled sequence is 2020-05-10. The analysis (eg time since last sample) is therefore undertaken from this date.
<br/>
15866 sequences in the UK have been included in this analysis.
7125 lineages have been recorded, 5958 of which only contain one sequence.

Note: the size of a lineage may be due to a low amount of transmission of this lineage, but it is likely also that it just hasn't been sampled as frequently, especially for newer lineages.

Sequences which were replicates or too error-prone were removed from this analysis.



6787 are lineages which only contained five sequences or fewer, and so have been left out of visualisation in the interests of clarity



Of the 338 that remain:
163 are pending extinction, ie last seen three weeks ago.
80 have not been seen for more than one month, and so are viewed as extinct, but will continue to be monitored.
65 lineages have gone quiet, ie haven't been seen this week.
2 lineages have reactivated.
28 lineages have been continuously circulating.


The following table contains information about lineages and the number of sequences in each country in the UK for each lineage, in reverse size order. 
Each entry is the count of sequences from each lineage in each country, with the percentage of the total sequences from that lineage that this count represents.

It is also written to "summary_files" as "lineage_summary.tsv" for further use.

These data is represented in the stacked bar chart below. Note that the number of sequences is likely to be due more to differing sampling efforts in different regions, rather than genuine differences in numbers of cases. 

The raw data for this bar chart are in the table above.

The relative growth and decline of the ten most sampled lineages in terms of number of counties they are present in is shown below. 
The raw data for the plot is shown below it, with each column representing a lineage, and the number of admin2 regions it is present in in each week.

These lineages are shown on the timeline below. Each line represents the length of the cluster, from oldest to most recent sampling date.
The dots are sized by the number of sequences taken on that date, and again are colour coded by country.
The raw data has been written to a summary file.
